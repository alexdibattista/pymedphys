# Pinnacle Export

This package was forked from [Pinnacle-tar-DICOM](https://github.com/AndrewWAlexander/Pinnacle-tar-DICOM). Many thanks to Andrew Alexander and his colleagues for providing that fantastic script.

Pinnacle Export generates DICOM objects from raw Pinnacle data.

**Caution: This package is intended for research purposes only and should not be used clinically!**

## Getting Started

**TODO** A command line interface is provided and should be made easily accessible within pymedphys.

For now just work off the sample Jupyter notebook, located at notebooks/pinnacle/ExportSample.ipynb
