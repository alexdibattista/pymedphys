# Sharebles

Here is where the Python Medical Physics community can share script snippits.

These scripts should not be used as dependencies and they are not actively tested.
Any functions within these scripts that are reusable for other purposes
should be moved into the PyMedPhys library itself. Any part that needs testing
should be included as a function within PyMedPhys and use the pytest framework within
the library.

To add a script to this directory please follow the instructions at <http://pymedphys.com/en/latest/developer/contributing.html>
