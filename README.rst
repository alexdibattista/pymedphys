PyMedPhys (https://pymedphys.com)
=================================

Description
-----------
The PyMedPhys Project aims to develop a common core package for Medical Physics
in Python and foster an ecosystem of interoperable Medical Physics packages. It
is inspired by our Astronomy Physics peers and their `Astropy Project`_.

.. _`Astropy Project`: http://www.astropy.org/

This package is available on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/pymedphys/),
GitLab (https://gitlab.com/pymedphys/pymedphys), and conda-forge
(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pymedphys)

We want you on this list. We want you, clinical Medical Physicist, to join our
team. Even if all you feel comfortable contributing to is documentation.

The aim of PyMedPhys is that it will be developed by an open community of
contributors. We use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors
to maintain the copyright on their contributions. All code is licensed under
the AGPLv3+ with additional terms from the Apache-2.0 license.
